        our Wisconsin farmhouse ale. Brewed with flaked barley and the finest Wisconsin
        malts. We even give a nod to our farmers with a little hint of corn. \n\nNaturally
        cloudy we allow the yeast to remain in the bottle to enhance fullness of flavors,
        which cannot be duplicated otherwise. \n\nExpect this ale to be fun, fruity
        and satisfying. You know you''re in Wisconsin when you see the Spotted Cow.","abv":4.800000190734863,"style":"American-Style
